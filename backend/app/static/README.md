# Static Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the AgroADB backend.

## Logo

To add a custom logo to PDF reports:

1. Place your logo image as `logo.png` in this directory
2. Recommended size: 400x400 pixels (square format)
3. Supported format: PNG with transparent background (preferred)

If no logo is present, PDF reports will be generated without a logo on the cover page.
